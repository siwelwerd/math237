\begin{frame}\frametitle{Interpreting Feedback}
On each assessment, for each standard you will receive one of the following marks.
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Demonstrated Excellence} means you demonstrated \textbf{Excellence} of that standard.
      Great job!  Check off another box on your progress sheet.
\item {\bf Minor Revision Needed} means you have demonstrated understanding, but made a minor mistake (e.g. arithmetic) or not written a complete solution.  Often, notation is poor or ambiguous.  You can upload a complete re-working of the same problem (fixing any errors) as a comment on the assessment in Canvas to demonstrate excellence.
\item {\bf Reassessment Needed} means you made a good faith effort and demonstrated
      partial understanding, but not complete understanding. You will need to attempt a new problem on a different assessment. 
\end{itemize}


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Assessment Opportunities}
Checkmarks may be earned as follows.
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Quizzes}: Most weeks, one day at the end of class we will have a quiz. 
\item {\bf Exams}: Periodically we will have longer assessments (usually on Friday).
\item {\bf On-Demand Reassessments}: One standard reassessments through Canvas
\end{itemize}

The assessment method (quiz/exam/etc.) you used to earn a checkmark
isn't important: \textbf{I only care that you
learn the material and demonstrate that learning to me before the end of the
semester!}
