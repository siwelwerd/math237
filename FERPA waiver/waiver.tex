\large \bf \course\ Email Waiver
\end{center}

As a service to students, I have a computer program that can automatically email you a progress report every week, listing which standards you have mastered, and a complete record of each assignment.  You may opt into or out of this service at anytime.  You can keep track of your progress in the course yourself using the checklist, and you are always welcome to come by my office hours to discuss and/or verify your progress. \\
